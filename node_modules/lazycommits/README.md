# LazyCommits 🚀

**Keeps your GitHub contribution graph active and green, naturally.** 🟩

Built for **fun** and **peak developer laziness**, **LazyCommits** automates your pushes so you don't have to. Instead of spamming 100 robotic commits at once, it waits for random, human-like intervals (20-45 mins) and groups your work into meaningful batches. It even caps itself at ~20 commits a day so you don't look suspicious. 🕵️‍♂️
